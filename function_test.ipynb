Fort Huachuca desires a comprehensive history of the fort for use in better understanding how its various facilities integrate into the overall history and development of the fort and its existing National Historic Landmark (NHL) and proposed existing evaluated, eligible, and listed National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties and districts. This comprehensive history will help ENRD in making determinations on how to address future National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nominations and/or recommendations for adding new historic districts or expanding the existing historic district.

The historic context will be used by cultural resources personnel to evaluate and manage the resources appropriately. Various historic training range features (e.g., structures, fragments, and items left over from previous activities) are located across the ranges of Fort Huachuca, representing its long and storied history. To help identify and catalog these features, ERDC-CERL conducted a field survey of the training ranges in 2016 in or-der to photograph the historic range features. Forty-one historic range features were identified. Researchers conducted archival research, literature reviews, and image analysis of historic and current maps and photographs to identify the 41 historic range features and place them within a chronological context of Fort Huachuca's training ranges. The report concludes with guidance on how to identify and associate sites and features within the overall historic training range chronology and evaluate them appropriately for significance and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility.\",\n",

This work inventoried and evaluated the historic landscapes within the National Landmark District at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. A historic landscape context was developed; an inventory of all landscapes and landscape features within the historic district was completed; and these landscapes and features were evaluated using methods established in the Guidelines for Identifying and Evaluating Historic Military Landscapes (ERDC-CERL 2008) and their significance and integrity were determined. Photographic and historic documentation was completed for significant landscapes.

       "   'abstract': 'Many temperate passerine bird species switch from diets of mostly invertebrates in the spring and summer to diets that include fruit and seeds in the fall and winter. However, relatively few studies have quantified diet composition or the extent of seasonal shifts during the non-breeding period, particularly among species and across communities with both residents and migrants. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values in food items (fruits, C3 and C4 seeds, and insects from various trophic levels and plant communities) and in multiple tissues (feathers and plasma/whole blood) from 11 species of songbirds wintering in the southeastern U.S. We combined these diet and tissue values with empirically derived discrimination factors and used concentration-dependent mixing models to quantify seasonal diet shifts. We also validated mixing model results with data from fecal samples. Diets in this bird community, as delineated N and C isotopic space, diverged in the fall and winter relative to the summer as consumption of fruits and seeds increased. Across this songbird community, estimated contributions of fruit to plasma/whole blood increased from 16.2 ± 7.5% in the fall (mean ± SD; range: 4–26%) to 21.7 ± 10.3% (range: 9–37%) in the winter, while contributions of seeds increased from 29.4 ± 2.6% (range: 28–32%) in the fall to 36.6 ± 4.8% (range: 32–42%) in the winter. Fecal data showed qualitatively similar trends to mixing models, but consistently estimated higher contributions of fruit. Our work indicates that fruits and seeds constitute substantial sources of sustenance for non-breeding songbirds, there is considerable separation of resource use among species in the fall and winter, and fecal estimates of contributions to songbird tissues should be interpreted cautiously.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Building 550 (former World War II fire station) is located on Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, and was recommended eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2018 (Smith and Adams 2018). The building is currently vacant. It is an intact example of an 800 Series World War II fire station with character-defining features of its period of significance from 1939 to 1946 on its exterior and interior. All buildings, especially historic ones, require regular planned maintenance and repair. The most notable cause of historic building element failure and/or decay is not the fact that the historic building is old, but rather it is caused by incorrect or inappropriate repair and/or basic neglect of the historic building fabric. This document is a maintenance manual compiled with as-is conditions of construction materials of Building 550. The Secretary of Interior Guidelines on rehabilitation and repair per material are discussed to provide the cultural resources manager at Fort McCoy a guide to maintain this historic building. This report satisfies Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended and will help the Fort McCoy Cultural Resources Management office to manage this historic building.',\n",

       "   'title': 'Fort McCoy, Wisconsin WWII buildings and landscapes',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'The U.S. Congress codified the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) mostly through the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which requires federal agencies to address their cultural resources. Section 110 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to inventory and evaluate their cultural resources, and Section 106 requires them to determine the effect of federal undertakings on those potentially eligible for the NRHP. This report provides a World War II development history and analysis of 786 buildings, and determinations of eligibility for those buildings, on Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. Evaluation of the WWII buildings and landscape concluded that there are too few buildings with integrity to form a cohesive historic district. While the circulation patterns and roads are still intact, the buildings with integrity are scattered throughout the cantonment affecting the historic character of the landscape. Only Building 100 (post headquarters), Building 656 (dental clinic), and Building 550 (fire station) are ELIGIBLE for listing on the NRHP at the national level under Criterion A for their association with World War II temporary building construction (1942-1946) and under Criterion C for their design, construction, and technological innovation.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This project was undertaken to provide the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration with a cultural landscape survey of Marietta National Cemetery. The 23-acre cemetery is located within the city limits of Marietta, Georgia, and contains more than 17,300 burials. Marietta National Cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on 18 September 1998, as part of a multiple-property nomination for Civil War Era National Cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration tasked the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center-Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) to inventory and assess the cultural landscape at Marietta National Cemetery through creation of a landscape development context, a description of current conditions, and an analysis of changes over time to the cultural landscape. All landscape features were included in the survey because according to federal policy on National Cemeteries, all national cemetery landscape features are considered to be contributing elements.

The Historic District contains contributing mansions constructed during the Gold Coast Era and Academy buildings constructed from 1942 to 1969. This report identifies several historic component landscapes within USMMA, and makes recommendations for their maintenance and preservation. This report establishes landscape guidelines to aid USMMA in preservation of the Historic District. This management plan inventories the existing cultural landscape at the USMMA, and it includes recommendations for managing the historic landscape in the future. The contributing landscapes are identified in the study, and their existing conditions discussed. Treatment recommendations for preserving and rehabilitating the landscapes are provided. This document meets the requirements for federal agencies to address their cultural resources which are defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. Especially relevant is Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires federal agencies to inventory and evaluate their cultural resources.

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract : This document is an architectural survey for 5 buildings (28414, Chapel; 32100, Theater; 33800, Administration; 36300, Bank, and 36302, Post Office) and 14 buildings (24401 through 24414, Barracks, Administration, and a Mess Hall) at Fort Gordon, Georgia. The Army constructed the 5 buildings from 1966 to 1977 and the 14 buildings in 1988. This survey satisfies Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended, and it was used to determine the eligibility of these 19 buildings to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It is the recommendation of this report that only Buildings 33800 and 36300 are significant under NRHP criteria; however, only Building 36300 retains enough integrity to be eligible for the NRHP under Criteria C. Buildings 24401 through 24414 did not meet the requirements for exceptional importance under Criteria Consideration G and therefore need to be reevaluated when they reach 50 years of age.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The cryptic behavior of migrating bats leaves us largely uninformed of their seasonal distribution and abundance, important movement corridors, and migration behaviors. However, models of avian migration in relation to meteorological variables may prove useful in describing seasonal patterns of coastal bat activity. We pursued 2 primary objectives regarding regional autumn bat activity along the Atlantic Coast of southern New England, United States, inferred from continuous acoustic monitoring: 1) to evaluate hypotheses regarding the association of regional atmospheric conditions and coastal bat activity and 2) to construct and evaluate models that predict regional bat activity on a given night using meteorological data accessed ahead of the activity. Acoustic bat activity was attributable primarily to 2 species of migratory tree bats, red bat and silver-haired bat, but also the shortdistance migrant tricolored bat and generally sedentary big brown bat. Myotis spp. and hoary bat detections were relatively uncommon among classified calls. Coastal bat activity varied with regional wind conditions indicative of cold front passage and expected to induce a more coastal flight path, but associations with other atmospheric conditions from models of songbird migration were typically weak. Bat acoustic activity also was associated strongly with various aspects of temperature. Predictive models of regional nightly bat activity were reasonably accurate in anticipating nights of the highest and lowest bat activity, particularly for low-frequency bats such as silver-haired and big brown bat. The ability to anticipate high bat activity may help reduce adverse interactions with forthcoming wind energy development in coastal and offshore areas along the western Atlantic Ocean.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract. Nearshore waters provide very important habitat for sea ducks (Tribe Mergini) during migration and winter, but gathering information on sea duck use of shallow nearshore waters is challenging because traditional aerial and boat-based surveys are expensive, are usually conducted infrequently, and are often not feasible near the coast. The objective of this study was to use land-based surveys to characterize spatiotemporal variation in the abundance and behavior (e.g., foraging, flying) of Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) and scoters (Melanitta spp.) in nearshore waters of southern New England. Surveys (60–120 min per survey, n = 1,044 surveys) were conducted throughout the day from February 2009 to July 2010 to assess diurnal and seasonal variation in sea duck behavior and spatial distribution at nine sites in southern Rhode Island. The density of sea ducks resting or foraging on the water exhibited little diurnal variation, whereas flight activity dramatically increased nearer to sunrise. Sea duck densities and passage rates (individuals/km2/hr) peaked during migration periods from October through November and February through April, although there were important seasonal differences between sites. For example, the highest densities of Common Eider during fall were in a protected estuary, whereas abundance of scoters during fall was greater at a coastal headland. The relative activity of Common Eider on the water and in flight was similar among sites, whereas scoters exhibited highly variable activity among sites, particularly during winter and spring. The spatiotemporal patterns in abundance and behavior of sea ducks in nearshore waters that we detected using land-based surveys provides essential, complementary information to that available from other types of waterfowl and seabird surveys in southern New England.',\n",

Through Sections 110 and 106 of the NHPA, federal agencies are required to address their cultural resources, which are defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. This document contains the nomination form and all supporting documentation for listing the William Barstow Mansion property, located at 300 Steamboat Road, Kings Point, in Nassau County, New York, on the NRHP. The property is considered historically significant on a statewide level as a reminder of the Golden Age of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The property consists of two contributing features the William Barstow Mansion and garage which retain their integrity from the period of significance, 1915 1960. The property is part of the McNulty Campus of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and currently serves as the American Merchant Marine Museum. It was listed on 29 August 2014 as NRHP #14000539.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract : In the United States, the buildup for the Vietnam War included construction of mission-related buildings and structures to support the war. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, requires federal agencies to inventory and evaluate their cultural resources, usually as they near 50 years of age. The Vietnam-related structures are about to turn 50 and there is no existing historic context describing the development, construction, and use of these facilities. A broad overview from 1962 through 1975 highlights the Vietnam-influenced construction that created facilities on many installations. This new construction augmented the existing World War II-era infrastructure that became heavily utilized in support of the Vietnam War. By providing a broad foundation of the U.S. military s involvement in Vietnam, this report can be utilized to develop more detailed research that will lead to identification and evaluation of Vietnam-era facilities at Department of Defense military installations in the United States. This report s historic context provides military cultural resources professionals with a common understanding for determining the historical significance of Vietnam-era facilities, greatly increasing efficiency and cost-savings of this necessary effort.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The behavioral decisions of migratory songbirds during migration stopovers can markedly influence the pace, efficiency, and success of migration. An individual’s fuel stores are considered in theory to directly dictate subsequent stopover behavior (e.g., extent of foraging or vigilance, when to depart), although such decisions at stopover must also consider atmospheric factors (e.g., wind, precipitation) that influence the energetic costs of migration. We conducted the first study to date that directly manipulated the fuel stores of newly arrived songbirds at a stopover site, evaluated their effect on movement behavior and departure decisions, and assessed how atmospheric factors mediated these behavioral decisions. Hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus) captured during fall migration at a southern New England, USA, offshore island stopover site and subsequently released with increased fuel stores moved less and made more tortuous movements, were more likely to depart on a given night and regularly resumed migration earlier and in a seasonally appropriate direction relative to individuals released with little change in fuel stores. The importance of fuel stores in modifying behavioral decisions increased throughout the migration period, presumably in response to declining food abundance. Precipitation suppressed migrant movements during stopover and precluded departure. Migrants departed in light winds with little respect to wind direction. The pervasive influence of fuel stores on migrant stopover behavior underscores the central role of fuel acquisition in the dynamics, speed, and success of migration, as well as the importance of quality stopover sites to migratory birds.',\n",

       "   'title': 'Using Nocturnal Flight Calls to Assess the Fall Migration of Warblers and Sparrows along a Coastal Ecological Barrier',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Atmospheric conditions fundamentally influence the timing, intensity, energetics, and geography of avian migration. While radar is typically used to infer the influence of weather on the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of nocturnal bird migration, monitoring the flight calls produced by many bird species during nocturnal migration represents an alternative methodology and provides information regarding the species composition of nocturnal migration. We used nocturnal flight call (NFC) recordings of at least 22 migratory songbirds (14 warbler and 8 sparrow species) during fall migration from eight sites along the mainland and island coasts of Rhode Island to evaluate five hypotheses regarding NFC detections. Patterns of warbler and sparrow NFC detections largely supported our expectations in that (1) NFC detections associated positively and strongly with wind conditions that influence the intensity of coastal bird migration and negatively with regional precipitation; (2) NFCs increased during conditions with reduced visibility (e.g., high cloud cover); (3) NFCs decreased with higher wind speeds, presumably due mostly to increased ambient noise; and (4) coastal mainland sites recorded five to nine times more NFCs, on average, than coastal nearshore or offshore island sites. However, we found little evidence that (5) nightly or intra-night patterns of NFCs reflected the well-documented latitudinal patterns of migrant abundance on an offshore island. Despite some potential complications in inferring migration intensity and species composition from NFC data, the acoustic monitoring of NFCs provides a viable and complementary methodology for exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of songbird migration as well as evaluating the atmospheric conditions that shape these patterns.',\n",

       "   'title': 'Birds Select Fruits with More Anthocyanins and Phenolic Compounds During Autumn Migration',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Abstract We evaluated whether fruit selection by autumn-migrating birds at an important stopover site in southern New England was related to water-soluble antioxidant content of fruits. We measured total anthocyanins, total phenolics, and total antioxidant capacity in fruits from common native and non-native plant species and related this to estimates of fruit selection by free-living birds. Birds selected certain fruits over others, with arrowwood (Viburnum recognitum, V. dentatum) consumed at the highest rate, followed by Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) with much lower consumption of other fruits (e.g., oriental bittersweet [Celastrus orbiculatus], multiflora rose [Rosa multiflora], winterberry [Ilex verticillata]). Antioxidant concentrations primarily differed by shrub species and less so between sites. Arrowwood spp. had the highest total antioxidants, followed by Virginia creeper, northern bayberry (Myrica pennsylvanica), chokeberry spp. (Aronia prunifolia, A. melanocarpa), multiflora rose, winterberry, and oriental bittersweet. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that free-living birds select fruits based, in part, on antioxidant content. We suggest birds may actively select polyphenol/anthocyanin-rich fruits during autumn migration to protect themselves against the potentially damaging effects of oxidative stress caused by long-distance fasting flight.',\n",

The report meets the requirements in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) for federal agencies to address their cultural resources--defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. Identification of potentially significant properties is achieved only through a survey and evaluation to associate a property within a larger historic context. Building 839 was likely constructed in the middle 1850s by Daniel Kieffer and was utilized as a farmhouse for the farm. In 1860, Kieffer sold the farm to Richard Parker who continued to farm the land. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School acquired the farm in 1887 and utilized the house as living quarters for the farmer and classroom space for the farm unit of the school until 1918. After the War Department reacquired Carlisle Barracks in 1918, the farmhouse was used for officer housing. It is the determination of the current survey that Building 839 should be included within the existing Carlisle Indian Industrial School National Historic Landmark district for its use by the school to teach farming practices and animal husbandry.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Abstract : This work provides an historic context for military training lands, written to satisfy a part of Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended. Cultural resources personnel at the installation level and their contractors will use this historic context to determine whether military training resources are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and whether an adverse effect will take place. This overall project covered five types of military training: small arms ranges, large arms ranges, training villages and sites, bivouac areas, and large-scale operation areas. This document provides an historic context of large arms ranges on military training lands for the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Marines, with a focus on the landscape outside the developed core of military installations. This work determined that military training lands are significant enough in our nation's history to be surveyed for eligibility to the NRHP. However, training lands must be viewed as a whole; individual buildings on a training range are rarely eligible for the NRHP; buildings in their larger context (and the integrity of that larger context) are important.\",\n",

       "   'title': 'Migration and stopover ecology of songbirds and bats along a major ecological barrier',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Migration is a physiologically and energetically demanding period in the life cycle of a migratory animal. Most migrant songbirds alternate between periods of nocturnal flight, when energy is used, and stopover, when energy is accumulated for the next flight period; indeed, songbirds spend most of their time and energy on stopover. Conversely, the habits of migratory bats remain largely enigmatic, but there is reason to expect that models of songbird migration can inform bat migration research. I investigated, at multiple scales, the migration ecology of songbirds and bats and the stopover ecology of songbirds along the Atlantic Coast of southern New England. My research comprised four components: acoustic monitoring to explore the regional spatiotemporal dynamics of (1) songbird and (2) bat migration along the Rhode Island coast and relate them to synoptic weather conditions, (3) an experimental manipulation of arrowwood (Viburnum recognitum and V. dentatum) fruits, a preferred resource of omnivorous migratory songbirds on Block Island, to evaluate how resource consumption depends on consumer abundance at the landscape scale and the abundance and distribution of that resource at a neighborhood (local) scale, and (4) a field experiment that manipulated Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus) body condition (fuel stores) during stopover to isolate and evaluate its influence on subsequent stopover movement behavior and departure decisions on Block Island. Patterns of warbler and sparrow nocturnal flight call (NFC) detections largely supported our expectations in that NFC detections associated positively and strongly with wind conditions that influence the intensity of coastal bird migration and negatively with regional precipitation; increased during conditions with reduced visibility (e.g., high cloud cover); decreased with higher wind speeds, presumably due to increased ambient noise; and coastal mainland sites recorded four to seven times more NFCs, on average, than coastal nearshore or offshore island sites. Despite some potential complications in inferring migration intensity and species composition from NFC data, the acoustic monitoring of NFCs provides a viable complement to methodologies (e.g., radar) currently used to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of songbird migration as well as evaluating the atmospheric conditions that shape these patterns. Coastal bat acoustic activity varied with regional wind conditions indicative of cold front passage and expected to induce a more coastal flight path, but associations with other atmospheric conditions from models of songbird migration were typically weak; bat acoustic activity also associated with various aspects of temperature. Predictive models of forthcoming regional bat activity have direct conservation implications given that migration figures prominently in wind turbine-related bat fatalities and the imminent expansion of wind energy into the nearshore and offshore environments of New England and the mid-Atlantic. Predictive models were reasonably accurate in anticipating nights of the highest and lowest bat activity, particularly for low frequency bats. Thus, these predictive models may provide a regional migratory bat activity context for future site-specific applications that, in turn, inform turbine operations and reduce adverse interactions and fatalities. I conducted the first empirical and simultaneous test of the two primary predictions of contemporary models of plant-frugivore interactions within spatially explicit networks: (1) rate of fruit removal increases as densities of conspecific neighborhood fruits increase, and (2) fruit removal rate varies positively with frugivore abundance. Focal arrowwood plants in neighborhoods with high conspecific fruit density sustained moderately decreased fruit removal rates (i.e., competition) relative to those in low density neighborhoods, a result that agrees with most field research to date but contrasts with theoretical expectation. I suggest the spatial contexts that favor competition are considerably more common than the relatively uniform, low aggregation fruiting landscapes that promote facilitation. Patterns of arrowwood removal by avian frugivores generally varied positively with, and apparently in response to, seasonal changes in migratory frugivore abundance, but this effect varied with the distribution of arrowwood. My results underscore the importance of considering spatial context (e.g., fruit distribution and aggregation, frugivory hubs) in plant-avian frugivore interactions. Thus, contemporary theoretical models of plant-frugivore interactions, while quite useful, may not adequately characterize most empirical work to date, particularly in temperate systems that support seasonally abundant frugivores. As such, models of plant-frugivore interactions will benefit from the exploration of alternative or additional model parameters. Fuel stores in a migrating songbird, manipulated during stopover, directly affected stopover movement dynamics and departure decisions; however, their influence on stopover dynamic was most pronounced later in fall migration. Precipitation and wind additionally modified stopover and departure behavior. My results demonstrate the importance of placing stopover behaviors in the context of relevant intrinsic (e.g., endogenous time program) and extrinsic (e.g., resource distribution and abundance, topography, atmospheric conditions) factors. The effect of fuel stores on migration speed may be more pronounced along migratory barriers like the Atlantic coast, as larger fuel stores resulted in shorter stopovers and a more direct migratory route. The pervasive influence of fuel stores on migrant stopover behavior underscores the central role of fuel acquisition in the dynamics, speed, and success of migration and the importance of quality stopover sites to migratory birds.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This document presents a historic context, integrity analysis, structural analysis, and restoration cost estimate for the Mountain View Officers’ Club (Building 66050) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. The report meets requirements in the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) for federal agencies to address their cultural resources—defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. Especially relevant is Section 110 of the NHPA, requiring federal agencies to inventory and evaluate cultural resources. Identification of potentially significant properties is achieved only through a survey and evaluation to associate a property within a larger historic context. The club was dedicated on 6 September 1942 and was utilized for the recreation of black officers stationed at Fort Huachuca from 1942 until 1945. It is the determination of the current survey that while the Mountain View Officers’ Club is individually significant under Criterion A for the black military experience historic context and under Criteria A and C for the World War II temporary building historic context, it does not retain historic integrity under either criteria due to major modifications to both the setting and the building. Therefore, the Mountain View Officers’ Club is recommended not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.

The results serve to meet the requirements for federal agencies to address their cultural resources, defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. In April 2004, USAFA’s Cadet Area was nominated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL), creating the Cadet Area National Historic Landmark District (NHLD). This district was determined historically significant because of the design that architectural firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM) developed for the area.

The harbor is formed by the confluence of the Elizabeth River, the Nansemond River, and the James River. A Programmatic Agreement for the Closure and Disposal of Fort Monroe, VA has been executed between the US Army, the Virginia State Historic Preservation Officer (VA SHPO)., the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)., the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority (newly renamed the Fort Monroe Authority)., the National Park Service, and 27 other stakeholders interested in the preservation of Fort Monroe. In the PA, the Army agreed to provide a cultural landscape study and a viewshed analysis to the Consulting Parties. The viewshed analysis identifies significant historic viewsheds from and toward the Fort Monroe NHL District. The cultural landscape study examines the physical changes from Fort Monroe s earliest occupation due to man-made and natural forces and chronicle past land uses and identifies significant landscape features and spatial relationships, and other important aspects of the existing and historic landscape at Fort Monroe. During the research for the cultural landscape study and viewshed analysis, CERL researchers uncovered a large number of historic photographs, drawings, maps, and post cards of Fort Monroe over the past two centuries. This report is a collection of these resources.',\n",

As a strategically located defensive fortification, views and firing lines have been critical to the design, planning and operation of Fort Monroe. This report identifies fifty significant views that remain at Fort Monroe. Significance and integrity were evaluated for each of these views. Recommendations were made for preserving these significant views. The identified views were identified based on historic photographic documentation and the presence of a specific historic viewpoint. Unfortunately very little historic photo documentation exists of the military views associated with Fort Monroe, for example firing points from the fortification and batteries. Maps have been included of these firing points and discussion of the military importance has been included.',\n",

       "   'title': 'Deuterium Measurements of Raptor Feathers: Does a Lack of Reproducibility Compromise Geographic Assignment?',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Abstract.— \\n Despite the widespread use of stable isotopes in studies of avian movement, key assumptions on which the methodology is based remain unsubstantiated, including the assumption that measurements of stable hydrogen isotopes in feathers (&dgr;Df) are consistent across time within the same laboratory or among laboratories using the same analytical protocols and keratin standards. We tested this assumption by remeasuring &dgr;Df from 211 raptor feathers within and between laboratories. Initial and repeat samples were prepared and analyzed using identical protocols but analyzed in distinct automated runs with laboratory staff blind to sample identity. Reproducibility of &dgr;Df measurements varied significantly and substantially among nine independent sample groups. Feather &dgr;D measurements among sample groups exhibited average isotopic shifts from -15.6%‰ to +27.5%‰ (an absolute difference of 43.1%‰), with standard deviations from 6.0%‰ to 12.4%‰. Therefore, despite existing analytical protocols to address issues of reproducibility, empirical data suggest that comparing &dgr;Df measurements among studies or labs and pooling samples analyzed during different automated runs within a laboratory remain problematic. More importantly, poor reproducibility compromises the geographic assignment of origins based on &dgr;Df , because the substantial differences in &dgr;Df measurements between automated runs can result in spurious inferences regarding the origins of migratory birds. We caution against the continued use of &dgr;Df for predicting geographic origin, and for addressing important conservation questions, until the factors affecting poor reproducibility are identified and improved reproducibility is demonstrated within and among laboratories across time and taxa.',\n",

This report contains a survey of 15 buildings located at Anacostia Annex constructed by the Navy between 1920 and 1949. Naval District Washington provided a list of all buildings located at Anacostia Annex to the survey team. This work determined that only Buildings 168 and 169 are individually eligible for the NRHP. The removal of the former Naval Air Station runways, removal of the World War I era former Bolling Army Air Corps buildings, and integrity changes to the control tower (Building 92) have made Anacostia Annex ineligible as a historic district to the NRHP. Except for Buildings 168 and 169, the buildings comprising the Anacostia Annex are not significant enough in their own right to be individually eligible to the NRHP. The study also determined that no buildings meet the requirements for Cold War exceptional importance under criteria consideration \"g.\" The survey satisfies Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended, and was used to determine the eligibility of these buildings for inclusion on the NRHP.

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract Stable-hydrogen isotope ratios (deuterium:protium; δD) in feathers enable researchers to evaluate patterns of avian movement and to estimate the source areas of migratory birds. However, variation in feather δD remains inadequately described, thus confounding inferences of avian movement and origin. We assessed variation within a feather and among feathers within and between tracts in three species of immature raptors. Within contour feathers, measurements of δD increased from a distal section to an adjacent, proximal section; the magnitude of δD increase varied with raptor species. Furthermore, contour and flight feathers differed systematically in their δD content. Two explanations for intrafeather and intraindividual variation warrant further investigation: (1) hydrogen isotope fractionation associated with feather growth rate, and (2) the incorporation of temporal variation in environmental δD into growing feathers. We consider these explanations for raptors and passerines, which seemingly differ in the incorporation of deuterium into feathers. Additionally, corresponding sections of multiple contour feathers exhibited better measurement repeatability than multiple sections within a contour feather; the variability of multiple δD measurements within a feather tract (geometric SD: ±3.5%) suggests that biological effects on the repeatability of δD measurements from concurrently grown feather material are difficult to distinguish from analytical effects. In most cases, intrafeather and intraindividual variation can be minimized by informed sample selection decisions, but both sources of variation must be considered when stable-hydrogen isotopes are used to infer the geographic origins of migrants, ascertain migratory connectivity, and facilitate avian conservation decisions.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Abstract : Through the years, the United States Congress has enacted laws to preserve the national cultural heritage. The first major Federal preservation legislation was the Antiquities Act of 1906. This Act was instrumental in securing protection for archeological resources on Federal property. The benefits derived from this Act and subsequent legislation precipitated an expanded and broader need for the preservation of historic cultural resources. With this growing awareness, the United States Congress codified the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), the most sweeping cultural resources legislation to date. The Congress created the NHPA to provide guidelines and requirements aimed at preserving tangible elements of the nation's past primarily through the creation of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Contained within this piece of legislation are requirements for Federal agencies to address their cultural resources, defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object. Section 110 requires Federal agencies to inventory and evaluate their cultural resources. Section 106 requires the determination of effect of Federal undertakings on properties deemed eligible or potentially eligible for the NRHP. Fort Drum, New York, consists of 107,265 acres. Its mission includes command of active component units assigned to the installation, provide administrative and logistical support to tenant units, support to tenant units, support to active and reserve units from all services in training at Fort Drum, and planning and support for the mobilization and training of almost 80,000 troops annually. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) inventory 17 buildings and structures dating from 1941 to 1994, (2) research the history of these 17 buildings and structures, and (3) assess the eligibility of the buildings and structures according to NRHP guidelines.\",\n",

This document serves to meet the requirements for Federal agencies to address their cultural resources, defined as any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object, specifically, Section 110 which requires Federal agencies to inventory and evaluate their cultural resources. The layout of the cantonment in response to the rolling hills and terrain of the Ozarks Highlands has quite an impact on the scenic views, the curvilinear roadways and the park-like open space on the parade ground. While the current layout, land use, and roadways remain very similar to the historic WWII landscape, field reconnaissance and historical data analysis did not provide sufficient evidence for the whole cantonment as a historic district. However, several component landscapes throughout the cantonment were determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. These landscapes include Veterans Park, Gammon Field, the Old Post Headquarters and the Red Cross Building, and the WWII Temporary Historic District. In addition, this report makes several recommendations for the maintenance and upkeep of the eligible component landscapes.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This document is an architectural survey, historic context, and measured drawings of stonework elements created by German POWs during World War II throughout the cantonment of Fort Leonard Wood. The German POWS created the stonework from 1943 to 1946. The POWs built sidewalks, steps, retaining walls, foundations, chimneys, patios, bridges, and culverts. In May 2004, the Fort Leonard Wood Directorate of Public Works, Environmental Division retained ERDC-CERL to write an architectural survey, historic context, and measured drawings for the German POW stonework that had been declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. This report satisfies Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended (NHPA). The researchers determined that there are two historic districts directly attributed to the German POWs and their associated stonework throughout the Fort Leonard Wood cantonment. They are the: German POW Stonework Historic District German POW Fire Hydrant Plinth Historic District The researchers also determined that the POW stonework in the already eligible WWII Temporary Historic District is a contributing feature to that historic district. Several recommendations for the maintenance and upkeep of the POW stonework can be found in chapters 5 and 6.

The Childers family built the house during the years of 1938 and 1939. The cultural resources firm of Dennison and O'Malley found the building ineligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination in 1977, determining that the house did not meet the NRHP Criteria. A more detailed report in the 1990s concurred with the 1977 evaluation; however, in 1997, the Tennessee State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) made a determination that the Childers House appeared to be eligible for listing on the NRHP under Criterion C: architecture due to a resemblance to Gunston Hall, Virginia. The Fort Campbell Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP) recommended a complete documentation and re-evaluation of the building. This report satisfies Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended and will help the Fort Campbell Cultural Resources Office and Directorate of Public Work in managing this historic building.\",\n",

       "   'title': 'VARIATION IN THE STABLE-HYDROGEN ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF NORTHERN GOSHAWK FEATHERS: RELEVANCE TO THE STUDY OF MIGRATORY ORIGINS',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Abstract The analysis of stable-hydrogen isotope ratios in feathers (δDf) allows researchers to investigate avian movements and distributions to an extent never before possible. Nonetheless, natural variation in δDf is poorly understood and, in particular, its implications for predictive models based on stable-hydrogen isotopes remain unclear. We employed hierarchical linear modeling to explore multiple levels of variation in the stable-hydrogen isotope composition of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) feathers. We examined (1) inter-individual variation among goshawks from the same nest, and (2) intra-individual variation between multiple feathers from the same individual. Additionally, we assessed the importance of several factors (e.g., geographic location, climate, age, and sex characteristics) in explaining variation in δDf. Variation among individuals was nearly eight times the magnitude of variation within an individual, although age differences explained most of this inter-individual variation. In contrast, most variation in δD values between multiple feathers from an individual remained unexplained. Additionally, we suggest temporal patterns of δD in precipitation (δDp) as a potential explanation for the geographic variability in age-related differences that has precluded the description of movement patterns of adult raptors using δDf. Furthermore, intra-individual variability necessitates consistency in feather selection and careful interpretation of δDf-based models incorporating multiple feather types. Finally, although useful for describing the movements of groups of individuals, we suggest that variability inherent to environmental and intra-individual patterns of δDp and δDf, respectively, precludes the use of stable-hydrogen isotopes to describe movements of individual birds. Variación en la Composición de Isótopos Estables de Hidrógeno de las Plumas de Accipiter gentilis: Relevancia para los Estudios sobre el Origen de la Migración Resumen.\\u2003El análisis de los cocientes de isótopos estables de hidrógeno presentes en las plumas (δDf) permite a los investigadores estudiar los movimientos y distribuciones de las aves en un grado nunca antes posible. Sin embargo, la variación natural en δDf es poco entendida, y particularmente sus implicaciones sobre modelos que hacen predicciones con base en isótopos estables de hidrógeno aún permanecen poco claras. Empleamos un modelo lineal jerárquico para explorar múltiples niveles de variación en la composición de isótopos estables de hidrógeno en las plumas de Accipiter gentiles. Examinamos (1) la variación entre individuos de un mismo nido y (2) la variación entre varias plumas de un mismo individuo. Además, determinamos la importancia de varios factores (e.g., aislamiento geográfico, clima, edad y características sexuales) para explicar las variaciones en δDf. La variación entre individuos fue casi ocho veces mayor que la variación en un mismo individuo, aunque diferencias en la edad explicaron la mayoría de esta variación entre individuos. De manera contrastante, la mayor parte de la variación en los valores de δD entre varias plumas de un mismo individuo permaneció inexplicada. Además, sugerimos patrones temporales de δD en la precipitación (δDp) como una posible explicación para la variabilidad geográfica en las diferencias relacionadas con la edad que han imposibilitado la descripción de los patrones de movimiento de aves rapaces adultas utilizando δDf. Asimismo, la variabilidad intra-individual requiere que exista coherencia en la selección de plumas y una interpretación cuidadosa de los modelos basados en δDf que incorporen múltiples tipos de plumas. Finalmente, a pesar de ser útiles para describir los movimientos de grupos de individuos, sugerimos que la variabilidad inherente al ambiente y los patrones intra-individuos de δDp y δDf, respectivamente, impiden el uso de isótopos estables de hidrógeno para describir los movimientos de aves individuales.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Abstract : This report provides historical context for Fort Hamilton at Brooklyn, New York that emphasizes historical changes in its landscape. The goal was to identity the different stages of landscape change as defined by military mission and historical process. This enabled the establishment of accurate historic district boundaries and provided guidance for the development of a historic landscape management plan. The site is associated with important historical events of the region. Today, it is the military's only installation in the New York metropolitan area. As an urban installation, it is surrounded on three sides by one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. and on the fourth by water. Because of the inevitable urban development, much of the historic fabric has been lost. The Historic Fort area was identified as the only significant historic landscape at Fort Hamilton and is potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. This report also completes a future inventory need stated in the Fort Hamilton Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan for Historic Landscapes. Through the use of published materials, historical documents, photographs, and maps, this report reconstructs the landscape of Fort Hamilton.\",\n",

Knowledge Graphs o\\\\ufb00er a very useful and powerful structure for representing information, consequently, they have been adopted as the backbone for many applications in e-commerce scenarios. In this paper, we describe an application of existing techniques for enriching the large-scale Fashion Knowledge Graph (FKG) that we build at Farfetch. In particular, we apply techniques for named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking (EL) in order to extract and link rich metadata from product textual descriptions to entities in the FKG. Having a complete and enriched FKG as an e-commerce backbone can have a highly valuable impact on downstream applications such as search and recommendations. However, enriching a Knowledge Graph in the fashion domain has its own challenges. Data representation is di\\\\ufb00erent from a more generic KG, like Wikidata and Yago, as entities (e.g. product attributes) are too speci\\\\ufb01c to the domain, and long textual descriptions are not readily available. Data itself is also scarce, as labelling datasets to train supervised models is a very laborious task. Even more, fashion products display a high variability and require an intricate ontology of attributes to link to. We use a transfer learning based approach to train an NER module on a small amount of manually labeled data, followed by an EL module that links the previously identi\\\\ufb01ed named entities to the appropriate entities within the FKG. Experiments using a pre-trained model show that it is possible to achieve 89.75% accuracy in NER even with a small manually labeled dataset. Moreover, the EL module, despite relying on simple rule-based or ML models (due to lack of training data), is able to link relevant attributes to products, thus automatically enriching the FKG.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"87379938\", \"name\": \"J.

Existing knowledge graphs are incomplete. A lot of unstructured documents are hiding valuable information. But extracting and structuring that information is expensive. To help, the knowledge graphs can be populated (semi-) automatically. But knowledge graph population methods often assumes existing entities, yet, this is not the reality. To solve this, missing entities need to be detected and distinguished. To support an incoming stream of documents the out-of-KG entities are incrementally modelled. The first goal of the thesis is hence to create a novel entity linking method able to detect, distinguish and incrementally model out-of-KG entities. While the identification and modelling of potential out-of-KG entities are a step in the right direction, they still need to be included in the knowledge graph. To simplify the process, another goal is to generate short descriptions of newly identified entities. To accomplish that, a method building upon the representation of out-of-KG entities will be created which combines the properties of both graph-to-text and abstractive summarization methods. For training and evaluation, two silver-standard datasets, as well as one gold-standard dataset, will be created.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"2151647560\", \"name\": \"Cedric M\\\\u00f6ller\"}]}, {\"paperId\": \"63e0c02b84550a9e432c8fed4f6c6310c55f5222\", \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63e0c02b84550a9e432c8fed4f6c6310c55f5222\", \"abstract\": \"We propose a simple and practical method of named entity linking (NEL), and explore its features and performance on a dataset of ambiguous named entities - Namesakes.

Existing work usually takes pairs of entities as input and judges those pairs independently. However, there is often interdependence between different pairs of ER decisions, e.g., the entities from the same data source are usually semantically related to each other. Furthermore, current ER approaches are mainly based on attribute similarity comparison, but ignore interdependence between attributes. To address the limits of existing methods, we propose HierGAT, a new method for ER based on a Hierarchical Graph Attention Transformer Network, which can model and exploit the interdependence between different ER decisions. The benefit of our method comes from: 1) The graph attention network model for joint ER decisions; 2) The graph-attention capability to identify the discriminative words from attributes and find the most discriminative attributes. Furthermore, we propose to learn contextual embeddings to enrich word embeddings for better performance.

This paper presents two algorithms for RDF graph summarization: Grouping Based Summarization (GBS) and Query Based Summarization (QBS).

We empirically study the effectiveness of the proposed lossless RDF graph summarization to retrieve complete data, by rewriting an RDF Query Language called SPARQL query with fewer triple patterns using a semantic similarity.

Also, the comparison among similar algorithms is difficult because of the disconnected documentation. Information about algorithms is mostly present in websites, code comments, and so on. There is an absence of structured metadata to portray algorithms. As a result, sometimes redundant or similar algorithms are published, and the researchers build them from scratch instead of reusing or expanding upon the already existing algorithm.

To recap, according to our working definition, an entity is a uniquely identifiable \\\\u201cthing,\\\\u201d a typed object, with name(s), attributes, and relationships to other entities. Examples of some of the most frequent types of entities include people, locations, organizations, products, and events. Returning specific entities, instead of a mere list of documents, can provide better answers to a broad range of information needs. The way these information needs are expressed may vary from short keyword queries to full-fledged natural language questions (cf. Sect. 1.3.1.1). In this chapter, we adhere to the \\\\u201csingle search box\\\\u201d paradigm, which accepts \\\\u201cfree text\\\\u201d search queries, and simply treat queries as sequences of words, referred to hereinafter as terms. The task we are going to focus on is ad hoc entity retrieval: answering a one-off free text query, representing the user\\\\u2019s underlying information need, with a ranked list of entities. The fundamental question we are concerned with then is: How do we perform relevance matching of queries against entities? In Chap. 2, we have introduced large-scale knowledge repositories, like Wikipedia and DBpedia, that are devoted to organizing information around entities in a (semi-)structured format. Having information accumulated about entities in a knowledge repository is indeed helpful, yet it is not a prerequisite. As we shall see later in this chapter, it is possible to rank entities without (pre-existing) direct representations, as long as they can be recognized and identified uniquely in documents. The main idea of this chapter can be summarized as follows: If textual representations can be constructed for entities, then the ranking of these representations (\\\\u201centity descriptions\\\\u201d) becomes straightforward by building on traditional document retrieval techniques (such as language models or BM25). Accordingly, the bulk of our efforts in this chapter, described in Sect. 3.2, will revolve around assembling term-based entity representations from various sources, ranging from unstructured to structured. In the simplest case, these entity representations are based on the bag-of-words model, which considers the frequency of words but disregards their order. We will also introduce an extension to multiple document fields, as a mechanism for preserving some of the structure associated with entities.\", \"authors\": []}, {\"paperId\": \"69d3325f07c2865e903f2cf2d4229363896507b0\", \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d3325f07c2865e903f2cf2d4229363896507b0\", \"abstract\": \"Software-related platforms such as GitHub and Stack Over\\\\ufb02ow, have enabled their users to collaboratively label software entities with a form of metadata called topics. Tagging software repositories with relevant topics can be exploited for facilitating various downstream tasks. For instance, a correct and complete set of topics assigned to a repository can increase its visibility. Consequently, this improves the outcome of tasks such as browsing, searching, navigation, and organization of repositories. Unfortunately, assigned topics are usually highly noisy, and some repositories do not have well-assigned topics. Thus, there have been efforts on recommending topics for software projects, however, the semantic relationships among these topics have not been exploited so far. In this work, we propose two recommender models for tagging software projects that incorporate the semantic relationship among topics. Our approach has two main phases; (1) we \\\\ufb01rst take a collaborative approach to curate a dataset of quality topics speci\\\\ufb01cally for the domain of software engineering and development.

The second predictive model, however, assumes there are no topics available for a repository, hence it proceeds to predict the relevant topics based on both textual information of a software project (such as its README \\\\ufb01le), and SED-KGraph. We built SED-KGraph in a crowd-sourced project with 170 contributors from both academia and industry. Through their contributions, we constructed SED-KGraph with 2234 carefully evaluated relationships among 863 community-curated topics.

The customer queries are ambiguous and implicit. They may be looking for an exact match of their query, or a functional equivalent (i.e., substitute), or an accessory to go with it (i.e., com-plement). It is important to distinguish these three categories from merely classifying an item for a customer query as relevant or not. This information can help direct the customer and improve search applications to understand the customer mission. In this paper, we formulate search relevance as a multi-class classification problem and propose a graph-based solution to classify a given query-item pair as exact, substitute, complement, or irrelevant (ESCI). The customer engagement (clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases) between query and items serve as a crucial information for this problem. However, existing approaches rely purely on the textual information (such as BERT) and do not sufficiently focus on the structural relationships. Another challenge in including the structural information is the sparsity of such data in some regions. We propose Structure-Aware multilingual LAnguage Model (SALAM), that utilizes a language model along with a graph neural network, to extract region-specific semantics as well as relational information for the classification of query-product pairs. Our model is first pre-trained on a large region-agnostic dataset and behavioral graph data and then fine-tuned on region-specific versions to address the sparsity. We show in our experiments that SALAM significantly outperforms the current matching frameworks on the ESCI classification task in several regions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using a two-phased training setup (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning) in capturing region-specific information.

In this setting, records are clustered in a tree-like structure containing records at leaf-level and capturing record-entity (duplicate), entity-type (is-A) and subtype-supertype relationships.

Knowledge Graph Embeddings, on the other hand, are trained to predict missing facts for a knowledge base by mapping entities to a vector space. Each of these approaches has their strengths and weaknesses, and this article provides a survey of neuro-symbolic works that combine embeddings and rule mining approaches for fact prediction.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"136806596\", \"name\": \"Armand Boschin\"}, {\"authorId\": \"1772598\", \"name\": \"Nitisha Jain\"}, {\"authorId\": \"2166240706\", \"name\": \"Gurami Keretchashvili\"}, {\"authorId\": \"1679784\", \"name\": \"Fabian M.

In this paper, we propose CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of knowledge jointly for canonicalizing OKBs without the need of manually annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-view CH K-Means clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering qualities. In order to further enhance the canonicalization performance, we propose a training data optimization strategy in terms of data quantity and data quality respectively in each particular view to refine the learned view-specific embeddings in an iterative manner.

As a result, RE still suffers from unintended entity bias , i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the entity mentions to prevent the RE models from over-\\\\ufb01tting entity mentions. However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the semantic information of entities. In this pa-per, we propose the C O RE ( Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction ) debiasing method that guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without losing the entity information. We \\\\ufb01rst construct a causal graph for RE, which models the dependencies between variables in RE models.

Current KGC research mostly follows an entity ranking protocol, wherein the effectiveness is measured by the predicted rank of a masked entity in a test triple. The overall performance is then given by a micro(-average) metric over all individual answer entities. Due to the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity ranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples, raising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to guarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a systematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC evaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC paradigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experi-mentation, we create a relatively \\\\u201ccomplete\\\\u201d judgment set based on a sample from the popular FB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method. According to our analysis, it comes as a surprise that switching from the original labels to our \\\\u201ccomplete\\\\u201d labels results in a drastic change of system ranking of a variety of 13 popular KGC models in terms of micro metrics. Further investiga-tion indicates that the IR-like macro(-average) metrics are more stable and discriminative under different settings, meanwhile, less affected by label sparsity. Thus, for KGC evaluation, we recommend conducting TREC-style pooling to balance between human efforts and label completeness, and reporting also the IR-like macro metrics to reflect the ranking nature of the KGC task.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"2118861530\", \"name\": \"Ying Zhou\"}, {\"authorId\": \"49794910\", \"name\": \"Xuanang Chen\"}, {\"authorId\": \"2046814249\", \"name\": \"Ben He\"}, {\"authorId\": \"145303604\", \"name\": \"Zheng Ye\"}, {\"authorId\": \"145268796\", \"name\": \"Le Sun\"}]}]}\\n'"
